Python API Reference
====================

.. warning::
     This Python package is currently experimental and may be subject to change
     in future releases in ways that are not backwards compatible and without
     deprecation warnings.

The ``popxl`` package provides access to the PopART intermediate representation
for a computational graph of a model. It allows you to directly create (and to a
limited degree manipulate) PopART IRs.
