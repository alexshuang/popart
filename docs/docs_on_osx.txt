Installed a bunch of things (see poplar readme for an incomplete list:
breathe, sphinx, pdflatex, etc)

Note that the version of sphinx is important:
pip install sphinx==1.4.8
later versions fail to "import" breathe, see 
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3295

also, might need brew install sphinx-doc

Option clash for package:

some error with xcolor, made this change (on branch jamesn_osx). 
It removes a package include from the generated tex file. 

+            filly = open("%s/doc.tex"%(latex_dest))
+            lines = filly.readlines()
+            print("n lines = %d"%(len(lines)))
+            filly.close()
+            filly = open("%s/doc.tex"%(latex_dest), "w");
+            for l in lines:
+                if "xcolor" not in l:
+                    filly.write(l)
+                else:
+                    print("NOT writing %s"%(l,))
+
+            filly.close()
