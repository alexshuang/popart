/**
 * This class is responsible for lowering RNG/SR related Poplar calls to Poplar
 * sequences. With 'RNG state' we mean the state you can load/store with
 * Poplar's `getHwSeed/setHwSeed` functions. When using stochastic rounding, we
 * maintain two RNG states, one that is shared by all replicas, and one that is
 * not. This class implements methods to lower the logic for managing two
 * distinct RNG states.
 *
 * When stochastic rounding is enabled the assumption we make is that
 * `stochasticRoundingMethod` attribute is set for all Ops.
 *
 * NOTE: We have deliberately chosen to avoid adding this functionality in to
 * IrLowering to avoid adding too much into one class.
