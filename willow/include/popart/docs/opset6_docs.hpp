 average pooling consisting of computing the average on all values of a

 `auto_pad` is a DEPRECATED attribute. If you are using them currently, the output spatial shape will be following:

 ```
 pad_shape[i] = (output_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * strides_spatial_shape[i] + kernel_spatial_shape[i] - input_spatial_shape[i]

1) Trip count. Iteration count specified at runtime. Set by
   specifying the input M. Optional. Set to empty string to omit.
   Note that a static trip count (specified at graph construction time) can be
   specified by passing in a constant node for input M.
2) Loop termination condition. This is an input to the op that determines
   whether to run the first iteration and also a loop-carried dependency for
   the body graph. The body graph must yield a value for the condition variable,
   whether this input is provided or not.

This table summarizes the operating modes of this operator with equivalent
C-style code:

    Operator inputs defined as (max_trip_count, condition_var).

    input ("", ""):
        for (int i=0; ; ++i) {
          cond = ... // Note this value is ignored, but is required in the body
        }

    input ("", cond) // Note this is analogous to a while loop
        bool cond = ...;
        for (int i=0; cond; ++i) {
          cond = ...;
        }

    input ("", 1) // Note this is analogous to a do-while loop
        bool cond = true
        for (int i=0; cond; ++i) {
          cond = ...;
        }

    input (trip_count, "") // Note this is analogous to a for loop
        int trip_count = ...
        for (int i=0; i < trip_count; ++i) {
          cond = ...; // ignored
        }

    input (trip_count, cond)
        int trip_count = ...;
        bool cond = ...;
        for (int i=0; i < trip_count && cond; ++i) {
          cond = ...;
        }

        /* User-defined code (loop body) */

      // These below values are live-out from the loop and therefore accessible
      b_out; user_defined_vals; keepgoing_out;
    }

There are several things of note in this code snippet:

1) Values from the enclosing scope (i.e. variable a here) are in scope and can
   be referenced in the inputs of the loop.
2) Any variables which you wish to make available in the enclosing scope (i.e.
   the variables b and keepgoing) must be declared as either loop-carried
   dependencies (both at the op inputs and output and at the body net input and
   output) or scan_outputs.
3) Values created in the body cannot be accessed in the enclosing scope.

Note that the semantics of this op support "diagonal" or "wavefront" execution.
(See Step 3 here for an example:
https://devblogs.nvidia.com/optimizing-recurrent-neural-networks-cudnn-5/).
Frontends should emit multi-layer RNNs as a series of While operators (with
time being the inner looping dimension), with each successive layer consuming
the scan_outputs from the previous layer, possibly going through several
point-wise operators (e.g. dropout, residual connections, linear layer).

slice the input `data` tensor. If a negative value is passed for any of the
start or end indices, it represent number of elements before the end of that

number of elements in this dimension), it represents `n`. For slicing to the

Performs element-wise binary subtraction (with limited broadcast support).

If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the
shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second
tensor can either be of element size 1 (including a scalar tensor and any
tensor with rank equal to or smaller than the first tensor), or having its
shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the
mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set,
suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.

For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):

  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar tensor
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (1, 1), i.e. B is an 1-element tensor
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

Attribute `broadcast=1` needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.

static const char *__doc_popart_sum_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Element-wise sum of each of the input tensors. All inputs and outputs must
have the same shape and data type.
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_tanh_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Calculates the hyperbolic tangent of the given input tensor element-wise.
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_tile_opset6 =
    R"doc(Constructs a tensor by tiling a given tensor.
This is the same as function `tile` in Numpy, but no broadcast.
For example A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [1, 2], tile(A, B) = [[1, 2, 1, 2], [3, 4, 3, 4]]
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_topk_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Retrieve the top-K elements along a specified axis. Given an input tensor of
shape [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, r] and integer argument k, return two outputs:
  -Value tensor of shape [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{axis-1}, k, a_{axis+1}, ... a_n]
    which contains the values of the top k elements along the specified axis
  -Index tensor of shape [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{axis-1}, k, a_{axis+1}, ... a_n] which
   contains the indices of the top k elements (original indices from the input
   tensor).
Given two equivalent values, this operator uses the indices along the axis  as
 a tiebreaker. That is, the element with the lower index will appear first.
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_transpose_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Transpose the input tensor similar to numpy.transpose. For example, when
perm=(1, 0, 2), given an input tensor of shape (1, 2, 3), the output shape
will be (2, 1, 3).
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_unsqueeze_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Insert single-dimensional entries to the shape of a tensor.
Takes one required argument `axes`, a list of dimensions that will be inserted.
Dimension indices in `axes` are as seen in the output tensor. For example:
  Given a tensor such that tensor with shape [3, 4, 5], then
  Unsqueeze(tensor, axes=[0, 4]) has shape [1, 3, 4, 5, 1]
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_upsample_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Upsample the input tensor.
The width and height of the output tensor are:
  output_width = floor(input_width * width_scale),
  output_height = floor(input_height * height_scale).
Example:
  Given `data` tensor, width_scale, height_scale, mode,
  Upsample the input 4-D tensor in nearest mode:
  data = [[[
      [1, 2],
      [3, 4]
  ]]]
  width_scale = 2
  height_scale = 2
  mode = "nearest"
  output = [[[
      [1, 1, 2, 2],
      [1, 1, 2, 2],
      [3, 3, 4, 4],
      [3, 3, 4, 4]
  ]]]
)doc";

static const char *__doc_popart_logical_xor_opset6 =
    R"doc(
Returns the tensor resulted from performing the `xor` logical operation
elementwise on the input tensors `A` and `B`.

If broadcasting is enabled, the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted
to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. See the doc of `Add` for a
detailed description of the broadcasting rules.
